# AD7 - CTF Jeopardy Platform

A multi-competition CTF (Capture The Flag) Jeopardy platform built with Go.

## Features

- **Multi-competition support** — Create and manage multiple independent competitions, each with its own set of challenges
- **Challenge management** — Admin CRUD for challenges with static flag verification
- **In-competition flag submission** — Users submit flags within a competition context, with duplicate-solve prevention
- **Per-competition leaderboard** — Ranked by total score descending, ties broken by earliest solve time
- **Per-competition notifications** — Admin can post announcements scoped to a competition
- **Competition analytics** — Detailed statistics including overview, category-wise, user-wise, and challenge-wise analytics
- **Plugin system** — Extensible compile-time plugin interface for adding new features
- **Snowflake IDs** — All public-facing IDs use snowflake algorithm for distributed-friendly unique identifiers
- **JWT authentication** — Bearer token auth with admin role gating (user management handled externally)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Configure
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your MySQL and JWT settings

# Apply database schema
mysql -u root -p your_db < sql/schema.sql

# Seed test data (optional)
go run ./cmd/seed/

# Run server
go run ./cmd/server -config config.yaml

# Try the demo script
./scripts/demo.sh
```

## API Overview

### Authentication

All endpoints require a Bearer JWT token in the `Authorization` header. Admin endpoints additionally require `role: admin` in the token claims.

### Competition Analytics

The analytics plugin provides detailed statistics for competitions:

**Overview (`/analytics/overview`)**
- Total users, challenges, submissions
- Correct submissions count
- Average solves per user
- Average solve time (from competition start)
- Completion rate (average % of challenges solved)

**By Category (`/analytics/categories`)**
- Total challenges per category
- Total solves per category
- Unique users solved per category
- Average solves per user
- Success rate (correct / total submissions)

**User Stats (`/analytics/users`)**
- Total solves, total score, total attempts per user
- Success rate per user
- First and last solve time
- Ordered by total score descending, first solve ascending

**Challenge Stats (`/analytics/challenges`)**
- Total solves, attempts, success rate per challenge
- Unique users solved
- First solve time
- Average time to solve (from first submission to correct)

## Tech Stack

- **Go 1.22** with [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/v5) router
- **MySQL** via `database/sql`
- **JWT** (HS256) via `golang-jwt/jwt/v5`
- **Snowflake ID** — custom implementation for unique distributed IDs
